## Testing Checklist

### Unit Testing
- [ ] FFT analyzer unit tests
- [ ] Data source unit tests
- [ ] Variable configuration tests

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Live Watch to Waveform integration
- [ ] Debug session lifecycle
- [ ] Multi-variable monitoring
- [ ] Data export/import
- [ ] Configuration persistence

### UI Testing
- [ ] Light theme compatibility
- [ ] Dark theme compatibility

## Known Limitations

1. **Webview Initialization**: Codicons require `@vscode/codicons` package to be installed
2. **Data Persistence**: Data is cleared when debug session ends
3. **Maximum Variables**: Recommended limit of 10 variables for optimal performance
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Uses modern Canvas API features
